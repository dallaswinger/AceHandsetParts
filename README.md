# AceHandsetParts
An assortment of mods and replacement parts for the (stock) ACE VR Staccato handset. Modeled in fusion, measured off stock parts. Printed and tested. Some post-print sanding may be required. 

# Replacements
Replacement mag lever and mag release dimensionally accurate (enough) to stock parts to get you out of a bind if you break or lose either. 

# Mods
## Flat Trigger
a drop in flat trigger that has 66.5mm length of pull at the break from shoe face to backstrap. Recommend shimming bottom to reduce actual takeup further. Original file based off of [NeverGMs](https://github.com/NeverGM/ACE-VR-Handsets/blob/main/trigger_short_pretravel_.stl)

## Trigger lifter
a trigger lifter drop in replacement that shortens overtravel by 1.12mm. I personally stiffened the trigger lifter stop by shimming the foam insert with a qtip stick.
